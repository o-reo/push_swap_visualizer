# Push Swap Visualizer

This project is a visualizer for the **"PUSH_SWAP"** 42 School Project.

**Push Swap** is a program that takes as argument a space separated list of numbers and outputs a list of commands that can be used to sort them.

You can read the subject [here](https://github.com/Binary-Hackers/42_Subjects/blob/master/00_Projects/02_Algorithmic/push_swap.pdf).

## Install

- Clone the `push_swap_visualizer` repository into the directory where your `push_swap` project is located:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/o-reo/push_swap_visualizer.git
```

This project uses C++17, cmake, SFML and ImGui.

- Install required packages (if not already installed)
  For Debian-based systems, you can install the necessary packages using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install clang
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxrandr-dev
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
sudo apt-get install libfreetype-dev
```

For Apple Silicon Macs it is recommended to install:

```
brew install sfml
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

- Navigate to the `push_swap_visualizer` directory, create `build` directory, and navigate into the build directory:

```bash
cd push_swap_visualizer
mkdir build
cd build
```

- Generate the build files using CMake and compile the visualizer:

```bash
cmake ..
make
```

- Run the visualizer:

```bash
./bin/visualizer
```

## Usage

- If you've relocated your push_swap program, simply update the visualizer's menu directory from "../../push_swap" to the new path of your push_swap program. For instance, "../../new_directory/push_swap".

- In the **Values** window
  - Choose the size of the push swap input with the slider [Optional]
  - **Shuffle** the input [Optional]
  - The space separated values should be filled automatically, you can also put your own values
  - Set the Push Swap program path (Absolute or relative path).
  - **Compute** the sort commands, it will display OK when done.
- In the **Controls** window
  - **Load** the commands in the visualizer
  - **Start** the animation
  - Adjust the **Speed** as needed
  - **Pause** and go **Step** by step to see the details of your algorithm.
  - **Load** to restart the animation
